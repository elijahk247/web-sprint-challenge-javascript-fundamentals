// ==== Closures ==== 

/* Task 1: Study the code below and explain in your own words why nested function can access the variable internal. */


const external = "I'm outside the function";

function myFunction() {
  console.log(external);
  const internal = "Hello! I'm inside myFunction!";

  function nestedFunction() {
    console.log(internal);
  };
  nestedFunction();
}
myFunction();

// Explanation: 

/*
  The nested function can access the variable internal because the the variable is defined outside of the closure. 
  Like the function myFunction being able to call on the global variable external, nestedFunction can call on the variable internal because it was defined outside of its scope.
*/ 


/* Task 2: Counter */

/* Create a function called `summation` that accepts a parameter and uses a counter to return the summation of that number. For example, `summation(4)` should return 10 because 1+2+3+4 is 10. */
